                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
I am a first-year computer science student passionate about technology and innovation, particularly in artificial intelligence and its transformative potential. My academic journey reflects dedication and excellence, as evidenced by earning top achiever awards in two university modules. Beyond my formal studies, I am expanding my expertise through a machine learning course on Udemy, highlighting my commitment to continuous learning and staying ahead in the dynamic tech landscape.  

My long-term goal is to become a leader in artificial intelligence and machine learning, leveraging technology to drive innovation and solve complex problems that create a positive impact on society. I aspire to work on groundbreaking advancements addressing real-world challenges in healthcare, education, and financial technology. Additionally, I aim to mentor and inspire others, fostering diversity and inclusivity within the tech industry, and ultimately using my career to leave a lasting legacy of meaningful contributions.  

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a vibrant set of interests and hobbies that shape who I am. I love reading, exploring diverse topics, and acquiring new skills that broaden my perspective. I enjoy niche activities such as solving logic puzzles, experimenting with digital art, and delving into DIY electronics projects. Spending quality time with my loved ones is also a priority, as it nurtures my sense of connection and balance.  

Balancing these passions with a part-time job as a hairstylist has helped me cultivate exceptional time management, creativity, and interpersonal skills. I am motivated by the belief that hard work, education, and adaptability open the door to meaningful contributions. I am eager to use my talents and passion for technology to make a lasting impact in the field.
